Mainar, E., Peña, J.M. & Rubio, B. Total positivity and accurate computations with Gram matrices of Bernstein bases. Numer Algor 91, 841–859 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11075-022-01284-0

In this repository, the bidiagonal decompositions (BDA) of the Gram matrices of Bernstein bases of positive and negative degree are provided.

1. In [Gram_Bernstein](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/GramBernstein_NA2022/tree/main/Gram_Bernstein) the bidiagonal decomposition of the Gram matrix of Benrnstein basis of positive degree is provided. Experiment results obtained with the functions available in http://math.mit.edu/~plamen/software/TNTool.html are presented. We also include the relative errors obtained in Mathematica. 
2. In [Gram_Bernstein_Negative_Degree](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/GramBernstein_Negative_Degree/tree/main/Gram_Bernstein_Negative_Degree) the bidiagonal decomposition of the Gram matrix of Benrnstein basis of negative degree is provided. Experiment results obtained with the functions available in http://math.mit.edu/~plamen/software/TNTool.html are presented. We also include the relative errors obtained in Mathematica.
